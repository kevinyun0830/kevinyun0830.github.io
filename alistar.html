            <td>Alistar dashes to an enemy, taking its position and rams them, dealing 55 / 110 / 165 / 220 / 275 (+70% of ability power) magic damage and knocking them back a distance of 650.</td>

                Every trample pulse that hits at least one enemy champion grants Alistar 1 Trample stack, capped at 5. At 5 Trample stacks, Alistar's next basic attack against a champion deals 35-290 (at levels 1-18) additional magic damage and stuns the target for 1 second.</td>
