            <td>Ornn slams his hammer into the ground, sending a fissure in the target direction that stops early if an enemy champion is hit, dealing 20 / 45 / 70 / 95 / 120 (+ 1.1 per total attack damage) physical damage and slowing enemies hit by 40% for 2 seconds.</td>
            <td>Over the march he belches fire in a cone in front of him, dealing 12 / 13 / 14 / 15 / 16% of target's maximum health over the duration to enemies in the AoE (80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 damage minimum, which is also the damage dealt to minions). </td>
            <td>Ornn charges forward, dealing 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 40% bonus armor) (+ 40% bonus magic resistance) physical damage to enemies he passes through. Upon colliding with terrain, the dash stops and creates a shockwave, knocking up nearby enemies for 1 second.</td>
            <td>First Cast: Ornn summons an elemental at maximum range in the target direction that stampedes toward him, dealing 125 / 175 / 225 (+20% of ability power) magic damage and slowing enemies hit by up to 40 / 60 / 80% for 2 seconds based on distanced traveled (minimum 10% slow).Second Cast: Ornn dashes forward in the target direction. If Ornn collides with the elemental, he headbutts it, sending it stampeding again in the new direction and empowering it to knock up enemies hit for 1 second, reduced to 0.5 seconds after the first enemy champion hit. Call of the Forge God can affect enemies twice.</td>
