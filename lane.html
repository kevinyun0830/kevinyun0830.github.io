<h1>What is Lane?</h1>
    <p>In Lanes are the main paths that minions follow toward the Nexus. <br>
    Due to this, they are defended by turrets planted along the path that must be destroyed in order to push into the enemy base. <br>
    Each successive turret in a lane must be destroyed before damage can be dealt to the next structure.<br>
     Along each lane are located areas of brush for tactical maneuvering, such as juking and ganking. <br>
     Controlling a lane is a key tactical component of gameplay; early lane control in a game can put your opponents at a disadvantage by keeping them away from your turrets and denying last hits on minions for much-needed Gold. <br>

     <h2>Top</h2><img src="top.jpeg" width=200px>
     <p>A side lane is hard to escape from- and with only one champion to man the advance,<br>
         durable fighters and tanks are the most suited to survive on their own.</p>
         <h2>Middle</h2><img src="mid.jpeg" width=200px>
         <p>A Mage Mage or Slayer Assassin is focused on gathering experience to gain access to their abilities,<br>
             which the middle lane can effect other lanes because it is close to top and bottom lane. <br>
             The lane's smaller space is also attractive for champions with bad defense to easily retreat to safety under turret.
            </p>
            <h2>bottom</h2><img src="bottom.jpeg" width=200px>
            <p>A Ad Carry is focused on obtaining items rather than gaining their abilities, <br>
                so they won't mind a companion sharing experience.</p>
                <h2>jungle</h2><img src="jungle.jpeg" width=200px>
                <p> Junglers rely on killing neutral monsters in the jungle to keep up with their laning teammates in terms of gold and experience. <br>
                Junglers go to other lanes to help the laners to kill the other.</p>
