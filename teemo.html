            <td>Passive: Grants 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26 % increased movement speed until struck by a champion or turret. The passive is restored 5 seconds (static cooldown) after last being struck by a champion or turret.

                Active: For 3 seconds, Teemo gains double his passive movement speed and will not lose it even if he is hit.</td>
            <td>Passive: Each time Teemo attacks an enemy, he will poison the target, dealing 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+30% of ability power) magic damage on hit and 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 / 30 (+10% of ability power) each second for 4 seconds. The duration of this poison will be refreshed with every subsequent attack, but the damage does not stack.</td>
            <td>Teemo places a trap which stealths and arms in 1 second. It detonates if an enemy steps on it, dealing 200 / 325 / 450 (+50% of ability power) magic damage by poisoning nearby enemies, applying a 30 / 40 / 50% slow and revealing them for 4 seconds. The traps last 5 minutes. Teemo will store one every 30 / 25 / 20 seconds, and can have a maximum of 3 / 4 / 5 stocked up. Each cast requires and uses a trap. After death, Teemo respawns with 2 mushrooms.</td>
