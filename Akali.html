            <td>Akali restores 80 energy and detonates a smoke bomb in the target direction, creating a circular shroud that expands over the next 5 seconds into a ring. The shroud lasts 5 / 5.5 / 6 / 6.5 / 7 seconds and does not permeate terrain.</td>
            <td>Akali flips backward and fires a shuriken forward, dealing 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+0.35 per attack damage) (+50% of ability power) physical damage to the first enemy hit and marking them.</td>
            <td>Akali dashes at the targeted enemy champion in a range of 675-825 (depending on the distance from the enemy), dealing 125 / 225 / 325 (+0.5 per bonus attack damage) physical damage to all enemies she passes through.</td>
